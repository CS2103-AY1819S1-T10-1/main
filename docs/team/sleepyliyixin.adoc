== PROJECT: U-Schedule

---

== Overview

*U-Schedule* is a desktop calendar application for university students written for the project for the module CS2103
Software Engineering. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX for user feedback.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ToDoList feature*
** What it does: It allows users to record the tasks with different priorities that need to be completed and delete if completed.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because in addition to those events that occur at specific times, users also need to record tasks that do not have a specific time. These tasks can be assignments, projects or some simple plans that need to be finished. And if users record priorities, they can do tasks according to priority.
** Highlights: This enhancement uses a different model from calendar events and it need re-construct logic, storage and ui conponents.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Add a showDescriptionCommand to show description of task with a popup window.
** Make priorities displyed in different colors.

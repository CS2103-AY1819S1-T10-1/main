== PROJECT: U-Schedule

---

== Overview

U-Schedule is a desktop calendar application for university students written for the project for the module CS2103
Software Engineering. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX for user feedback. It
 is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *fuzzy search with filters*
** What it does: Allows the user to search for commands without having to type the exact matching words - e.g. "find event proj" to find a calendar event with "Project" in its name. Also allows the user to filter their search by date and time, and by tags, for more precise searching. Finally, it displays the most relevant results first.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it enhances the search feature, allowing users to search for events more conveniently and more precisely. This would improve the overall user experience as well as the ease of navigation for users of U-Schedule.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: Uses third party library https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy[fuzzywuzzy] for the fuzzy search

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

== PROJECT: U-Schedule

---

== Overview

U-Schedule is a desktop calendar application for university students written for the project for the module CS2103
Software Engineering. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX for user feedback. It
 is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

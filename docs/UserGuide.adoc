== Introduction

U-Schedule is for university students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their schedule*. More importantly, U-Schedule is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It features a calendar to manage regular events such as lectures and tutorials, as well as a todo list for upcoming deadlines. If you can type fast, you can manage both of these more efficiently with U-Schedule than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `u-schedule.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for this application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list event`* : lists all calendar events
* *`list todo`* : lists all todo items
* **`add event`**`t/CS2103 Lecture d/Abstraction, IntelliJ, Gradle s/2018-10-16 14:00 e/2018-10-16 16:00 v/i3 Auditorium tags/lecture` : adds a calendar event titled `CS2103 Lecture` to the calendar.
* **`add todo`**`t/CS2103 Assignment d/Version Control p/H` : adds a todo item titled `CS2103 Assignment` to the todo list.
* **`delete event`**`3` : deletes the calendar event marked `3`.
* **`delete todo`**`3` : deletes the todo item marked `3`.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add event t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add event t/CS2103 Lecture`.
* Items in curly brackets denote the choices of words that can be used. e.g. `add {event/todo}`
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `t/TITLE [tags/TAG]` can be used as `t/CS2103 Lecture tags/lecture` or as `t/CS2103 Lecture`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[tags/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tags/lecture`, `tags/cs2103` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION t/TITLE` is also acceptable.
* The second word specifies whether the command will operate on the todo list or the calendar. For example `add event` adds an event to the calendar and `add todo` will add an item to the todo list.
* Priorities on the todo list are either `H`, `M` or `L` for high, medium or low respectively.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding: `add`

Adds a calendar event to the calendar +
Format: `add event t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION s/START_DATETIME e/END_DATETIME v/VENUE [tags/TAG]...` +
Adds an item to the todo list +
Format: `add todo t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION p/PRIORITY`

****
* Adds the specified item to the calendar or todo list
* Since it is difficult to type a rigidly formatted date and time, a natural language date parser will try to parse the input for calendar events.
* The start and end datetimes can be word descriptions, such as 'the day after tomorrow', or '1 week from now'.
* If only a time is specified, Scheduler will assume you mean today.
****

[TIP]
A calendar event can have any number of tags. (including 0)

Examples:

* `add event t/CS2103 Lecture d/Abstraction, IntelliJ, Gradle s/2018-10-16 14:00 e/2018-10-16 16:00 v/i3 Auditorium tags/lecture`
* `add todo t/CS2103 Assignment d/Version Control p/L`

=== Listing: `list`

Shows the list of all calendar events / todo items in the calendar / todo list. +
Format: `list {event/todo}`

=== Editing: `edit`

Edits an existing item in the todo list. +
Format: `edit todo INDEX [t/TITLE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [p/PRIORITY]`

****
* Edits the calendar event / todo list item at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the calendar event will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the calendar event's tags by typing `tags/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit event 1 d/Abstraction v/i3 Auditorium` +
Edits the description and venue of the calendar event to be `Abstraction ` and `i3 Auditorium` respectively.
* `edit todo 2 t/CS2103 Project` +

=== Locating: `find`

Format: `find {event/todo} KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `CS2103 Lecture` will match `Lecture CS2103`
* All fields (title, description, etc) will be searched.
* The search does not look for only exact matches; slight differences and typos will attempt to be matched
* `CS2103 Lecture` will match 'CS210X Lectures', or 'Lecture CS'
****
Examples:

* `find event lecture` +
Returns `CS2103 Lecture` and `Lecture`
* `find todo cs2103 assignment` +

`delete event 2` +
Deletes the 2nd calendar event in the calendar.
* `find todo assignment` +
`delete todo 1` +
